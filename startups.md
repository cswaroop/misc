Here is my notes from [Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/)

What do you need to create a successful startup?

1. Start with good people
2. Make something customers actually want
3. Spend as little money as possible

You will fail, because of one of the above

Its hard, but doable.

## The Idea

You don't need a brilliant idea. You need a profitable idea.  
Something like offering a better technology than they have right now.

e.g How about replacing prevalent spreadsheet-based workflow by an application?
