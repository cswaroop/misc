Here is my notes from [Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/)

What do you need to create a successful startup?

1. Start with good people
2. Make something customers actually want
3. Spend as little money as possible

You will fail, because of one of the above

Its hard, but doable.

## The Idea

You don't need a brilliant idea. You need a profitable idea.  
Something like offering a better technology than they have right now.

e.g How about replacing prevalent spreadsheet-based workflow by an application?

What was google's Plan in initial days?
- to create a better search results by doing a computationally expensive link-graph analysis and push the resuls in a dead-simple web page.
 
What was WhatsApp plan in intial days?
- To connect families on a dataplan without internet-centered identity creation (email-based signup).

What was Facebook plan in intial days?
- To create a college-only (Harvard) social network, there by automatically bringing more "authenticity" to the network

What was Tableau (enterprise BI) plan in intial days?

- Provide "naive" users the ability to query (visual query) and create a visualizations that are based on human cognitive principles (not to burden consumer, which other tools lets you do).

What was the NetFlix plan in initial days?

- Found a business model that doesn't tax the lazy users.  Lazy to return the watched DVDs, no problem, you are not recovering the postage charge you pre-paid (via. monthly subscription) for NetFlix. The founder himself was embarassed to admit to his wife that he paid hefty fine at blockbuster at that time.

What was Intuit plan?
- Let housewives do the accounting and tax filings with help of software.  Founder watched his wife strugging to reconcile checks wrote to bank account balance.


look at something people are trying to do, and figure out how to do it in a way that doesn't suck

## People
Image them as "so-and-so is an animal". If you laugh, they're not. You don't need or perhaps even want this quality in big companies, but you need it in a startup.


What you should do in college is work on your own projects. Hackers should do this even if they don't plan to start startups, because it's the only real way to learn how to program
 
Being friends with someone for even a couple days will tell you more than companies could ever learn in interviews. 

just work on stuff you like with people you like.

Business was no great mystery.  Atleast its not like physics or medicine that requires extensive study.  (Then why even 2-Year MBA?) You just try to get people to pay you for stuff

Once I was forced to discard my protective incompetence, I found that business was neither so hard nor so boring as I feared. There are esoteric areas of business that are quite hard, like tax law or the pricing of derivatives, but you don't need to know about those in a startup
All you need to know about business to run a startup are commonsense things people knew before there were business schools, or even universities.   The rulers of the technology business tend to come from technology, not business

So if you want to invest two years in something that will help you succeed in business, the evidence suggests you'd do better to learn how to hack than get an MBA. 

There is one reason you might want to include business people in a startup, though: because you have to have at least one person willing and able to focus on what customers want.

Some believe only business people can do this-- that hackers can implement software, but not design it. That's nonsense. There's nothing about knowing how to program that prevents hackers from understanding users, or about not knowing how to program that magically enables business people to understand them.

If you can't understand users, however, you should either learn how or find a co-founder who can. That is the single most important issue for technology startups, and the rock that sinks more of them than anything else.

## What Customers Want

It's not just startups that have to worry about this. I think most businesses that fail do it because they don't give customers what they want. Look at restaurants. A large percentage fail, about a quarter in the first year. But can you think of one restaurant that had really good food and went out of business?


In nearly every failed startup, the real problem was that customers didn't want the product.

For most, the cause of death is listed as "ran out of funding," but that's only the immediate cause. Why couldn't they get more funding? Probably because the product was a dog, or never seemed likely to be done, or both.

The only way to make something customers want is to get a prototype in front of them and refine it based on their reactions.

As a Lisp hacker, I come from the tradition of rapid prototyping. I would not claim (at least, not here) that this is the right way to write every program, but it's certainly the right way to write software for a startup.
In a startup, your initial plans are almost certain to be wrong in some way, and your first priority should be to figure out where. The only way to do that is to try implementing them.

Like most startups, we changed our plan on the fly. At first we expected our customers to be Web consultants. But it turned out they didn't like us, because our software was easy to use and we hosted the site. It would be too easy for clients to fire them

We also thought we'd be able to sign up a lot of catalog companies, because selling online was a natural extension of their existing business. But in 1996 that was a hard sell. The middle managers we talked to at catalog companies saw the Web not as an opportunity, but as something that meant more work for them.
We did get a few of the more adventurous catalog companies. Among them was Frederick's of Hollywood, which gave us valuable experience dealing with heavy loads on our servers.

But most of our users were small, individual merchants who saw the Web as an opportunity to build a business. Some had retail stores, but many only existed online. And so we changed direction to focus on these users.

Instead of concentrating on the features Web consultants and catalog companies would want, we worked to make the software easy to use.

I learned something valuable from that. It's worth trying very, very hard to make technology easy to use. Hackers are so used to computers that they have no idea how horrifying software seems to normal people. Stephen Hawking's editor told him that every equation he included in his book would cut sales in half. When you work on making technology easier to use, you're riding that curve up instead of down. A 10% improvement in ease of use doesn't just increase your sales 10%. It's more likely to double your sales.

How do you figure out what customers want? Watch them. One of the best places to do this was at trade shows. Trade shows didn't pay as a way of getting new customers, but they were worth it as market research. We didn't just give canned presentations at trade shows. We used to show people how to build real, working stores. Which meant we got to watch as they used our software, and talk to them about what they needed.

Indeed, you can use this as a way to generate ideas for startups: what do people who are not like you want from technology?

The best odds are in niche markets. Since startups make money by offering people something better than they had before, the best opportunities are where things suck most. And it would be hard to find a place where things suck more than in corporate IT departments. You would not believe the amount of money companies spend on software, and the crap they get in return. This imbalance equals opportunity.


If you want ideas for startups, one of the most valuable things you could do is find a middle-sized non-technology company and spend a couple weeks just watching what they do with computers  (I have spend couple of years in a mid-size, non-technology company, actually mortgage servicer)

So if you want to win through better technology, aim at smaller customers.

They're the more strategically valuable part of the market anyway. In technology, the low end always eats the high end. It's easier to make an inexpensive product more powerful than to make a powerful product cheaper.

If you build the simple, inexpensive option, you'll not only find it easier to sell at first, but you'll also be in the best position to conquer the rest of the market.
It's very dangerous to let anyone fly under you. If you have the cheapest, easiest product, you'll own the low end.
And if you don't, you're in the crosshairs of whoever does.
