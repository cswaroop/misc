Here is my notes from [Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/)

What do you need to create a successful startup?

1. Start with good people
2. Make something customers actually want
3. Spend as little money as possible

You will fail, because of one of the above

Its hard, but doable.

## The Idea

You don't need a brilliant idea. You need a profitable idea.  
Something like offering a better technology than they have right now.

e.g How about replacing prevalent spreadsheet-based workflow by an application?

What was google's Plan in initial days?
- to create a better search results by doing a computationally expensive link-graph analysis and push the resuls in a dead-simple web page.
 
What was WhatsApp plan in intial days?
- To connect families on a dataplan without internet-centered identity creation (email-based signup).

What was Facebook plan in intial days?
- To create a college-only (Harvard) social network, there by automatically bringing more "authenticity" to the network

What was Tableau (enterprise BI) plan in intial days?

- Provide "naive" users the ability to query (visual query) and create a visualizations that are based on human cognitive principles (not to burden consumer, which other tools lets you do).

What was the NetFlix plan in initial days?

- Found a business model that doesn't tax the lazy users.  Lazy to return the watched DVDs, no problem, you are not recovering the postage charge you pre-paid (via. monthly subscription) for NetFlix. The founder himself was embarassed to admit to his wife that he paid hefty fine at blockbuster at that time.

What was Intuit plan?
- Let housewives do the accounting and tax filings with help of software.  Founder watched his wife strugging to reconcile checks wrote to bank account balance.
- 


look at something people are trying to do, and figure out how to do it in a way that doesn't suck
